---

# {{ title }}

Based in Xerta, Southern Catalonia, Mas de Cosme is an international non-profit creating spaces that protect nature and animals, foster freedom and equality, and promote a vegan lifestyle.
Through our network of fincas and committed people, we work for a sustainable and fair future — with education, self-sufficiency, and activism at our core.

Our name, Mas de Cosme, means both “more of the cosmos” and “country house of the universe.”
It reflects our spirit: thinking beyond borders, expanding horizons, and embracing diversity under the stars of the Terres de l’Ebre.
