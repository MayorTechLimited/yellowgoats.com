title: Mas de Cosme - Where Nature, Freedom & Community Meet
---

# {{ title }}

Based in Xerta, Southern Catalonia, Mas de Cosme is an international non-profit creating spaces that protect nature and animals, foster freedom and equality, and promote a vegan lifestyle.
Through our network of fincas and committed people, we work for a sustainable and fair future — with education, self-sufficiency, and activism at our core.

Our name, Mas de Cosme, means both “more of the cosmos” and “country house of the universe.”
It reflects our spirit: thinking beyond borders, expanding horizons, and embracing diversity under the stars of the Terres de l’Ebre.

## The idea

Shaken by the recent wildfire right at our doorstep—and inspired by the idea of emerging stronger from every crisis—we looked for ways to naturally prevent such disasters.
We discovered the Goat Brigade of the Los Angeles Fire Department and were immediately excited by the idea of bringing this concept to the Terres de l’Ebre region.

Thus, the vision of our own brigade was born. We named it YellowGota — the Catalan goat brigade, a preventive service dedicated to protecting our landscapes.


## Unity

Our goats and sheep are especially grateful.
As a symbol of their freedom, they help care for our beloved mountain landscape—and in doing so, they make an important contribution to wildfire prevention. Pretty amazing work, right?

No one can do everything alone—here, one is none, two are more than one.
But only when we are three or more can we truly make a difference.

Our brigade is growing every day and getting stronger.
Join our team and be part of us—together we show the power of team spirit.

You can get involved by volunteering on site, supporting us financially, sharing our work on social media, or spreading the word.
Or by adopting and saving an animal.

Together we are strong—together we protect our nature!
